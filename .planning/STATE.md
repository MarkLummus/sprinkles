# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-05)

**Core value:** Make something you like, understand how it turned out, and know what to keep or change next time.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Read the churned recipe

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Read the churned recipe) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-09-05 — Phase 01 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table; product decisions D01–D16 live in `product-requirements/03-decision-register.md` and are accepted.

- Roadmap: Milestone 1 is four vertical slices on the olive oil working case (read → record → develop → print), not technical layers.
- Roadmap: No storage/backend phase — D16 stays open, milestone 1 uses a provisional local store behind a repository seam.
- Roadmap: UX1-01–UX1-03 are verified end-to-end in Phase 4 but are build constraints in every phase.
- [Phase 01]: Version-embedded ingredient row promoted as the primary identity model — a shared library is a future source a version copies from, never a render-time authority.
- [Phase 01]: Reused old-sprinkles library.js/olive-oil.js transcription verbatim (dextrose PAC 190, salt PAC 580) rather than the competing 103-row seed database, per D-01.
- [Phase 01]: Vitest defaults to environment:'node' so the domain suite is provably DOM-free; component tests opt into a DOM environment per-file.
- [Phase 01]: Bookcloth colour chosen as a muted bottle green (#33513B), a third hue distinct from ink and pen blue, used only for plain-language block-name running heads — every block wears its name per the brief's carried raise; bookcloth identifies the book in running heads/section tabs and never carries state, so it needed a hue that could never be mistaken for status.
- [Phase 01]: [Phase 01, Plan 03]: PAC and POD figures list msnf among their contributing fields so the basis they report never under-states the lactose term's dairy MSNF dependency; a figure's basis is the worst basis across all its contributing fields, not just its own.
- [Phase 01]: [Phase 01, Plan 03]: Fixed two arithmetically inconsistent describeDeviation examples in the 01-03 plan's own test spec (value/band pairs that could not produce the stated words) rather than encoding impossible expectations into the test; documented as Rule 1 deviations in the plan's SUMMARY.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Impeccable initialized 2026-09-05: `PRODUCT.md` written; surface brief for the recipe surface and bench sheet confirmed by Mark (`.impeccable/surfaces/`, direction "The Formulation Cookbook" expanding the Cupping Form, seed d1a5d80a, code-led). Phase 1, 3, and 4 prerequisites met. No DESIGN.md yet: it is written at finish from the built world. Phase 2 still needs the batch-record brief.
- Ingredient seed dataset undecided — three candidates disagree on coefficients (dextrose PAC 174.8 vs 190; salt 586 vs 580). Chosen in Phase 1 planning after the recipe data model exists.
- Working-case batch facts (2 Aug churn, as-made amounts, tasting figures) are an unconfirmed transcription. Mark confirms them in Phase 2 discussion.
- Stack (React + Vite + JSX) is provisional until Phase 1 ships; testing framework is unchosen and must be surfaced, not assumed.
